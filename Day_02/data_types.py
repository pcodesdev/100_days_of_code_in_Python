# An f-string, also known as a formatted string literal, is a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, making it easier to format and create strings with variables, expressions, and values. F-strings are created by prefixing a string literal with the letter 'f' or 'F'. Within an f-string, you can use curly braces {} to enclose expressions that are evaluated at runtime and replaced with their values in the resulting string.

# The key points are:
#
# A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4
# Except if it is divisible by 100, then it isn't
# Unless it is also divisible by 400, then it is
# So the steps are:
#
# Check if the year is divisible by 4
# If yes, go to next step
# If no, return False - not a leap year
# Check if year is divisible by 100
# If yes, go to next step
# If no, return True - it is a leap year
# Check if year is divisible by 400
# If yes, return True - it is a leap year
# If no, return False - not a leap year
# This will correctly determine if a given year is a leap year in Python.
